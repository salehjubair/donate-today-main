                    literally can mean a case of life or death for some.While all gifts are gratefully received, a
                    regular donation is best for the charity to be able to plan ahead to achieve its goals in relieving
                    people from poverty.</p>

            isolation.
            The longterm goal is for them to put food on the table, pay for education, and follow a path out of a
            generational cycle of poverty.</p>
